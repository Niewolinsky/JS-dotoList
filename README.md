# dotoList - The modern to-do list.

This is my first Javascript project, made completely from scratch without a framework, for learning purposes. It's yet another to-do list, that does nothing unusual, it works like you think it would. You are able to add notes with given title and actual note content. You can set a priority on your note, ranging from green being the least important to red being the most urgent. It automatiacally adds a timestamp so you can easily track how long ago you added the note.

Features:
- responsive design, mobile- and tablet- ready
- darkmode
- localStorage integration to save your notes in-between browser sessions
- cool design i guess :)

To-do (lol):
- backend for online note saving
- fixing issues with sticky header on scroll
- notes filtering & sorting by priority or timestamp
- add an options to disable animations, for slower devices
- other minor improvements

Technologies & tools:
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Chrome Web Tools
- Figma
- Photoscape X
- npm (_timeago.js, magic-grid, particles.js, tiny-throttle_)
- Snowpack
